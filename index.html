			<h2>Services</h2>
			<p>
				Before we sign a contract or write a line of code our team will spend the necessary<br/>
				time needed to understand your product vision.<br/>
				The outcome of this scoping session is a proposal or high-level statement of work.<br/>
				Based on your requirements, we can provide a complete offering or just the pieces you need.
